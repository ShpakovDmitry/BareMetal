### Real time counter RTC
The Real-time counte (RTC) module provides a generic, low power timer on the
low-frequency clock source(LFCLK). The RTC module features a 24-bit `COUNTER`,
a 12-bit(1/X) prescaler, capture/compare registers, and a tick event generator
for low power, tickless RTOS implementation.
