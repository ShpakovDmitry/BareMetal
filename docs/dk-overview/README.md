nRF52840 is an ultra-low power 2.4 GHz wireless system on chip (SoC)
integrating a multiprotocol 2.4 GHz transceiver, an Arm® Cortex®-M4F CPU and
flash program memory. It is the ultimate SoC for any short range wireless
personal area network or IPv6-enabled automation application.
nRF52840 supports Bluetooth® Low Energy, the ANT™, 802.15.4, and
user-proprietary 2.4 GHz protocols. Fully qualified Bluetooth Low Energy and
ANT stacks are available for the SoC. An 802.15.4 protocol library and a
certified USB stack are also available.
The nRF52840 SoC is part of the nRF52 Series that offers code-compatible devices
across the series and simple software migration from the nRF51 Series.
